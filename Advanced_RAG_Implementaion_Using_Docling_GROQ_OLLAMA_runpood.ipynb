Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domainspecific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-theart technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evaluation framework and benchmark.

To overcome challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant document chunks from external knowledge base through semantic similarity calculation. By referencing external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the problem of generating factually incorrect content. Its integration into LLMs has resulted in widespread adoption, establishing RAG as a key technology in advancing chatbots and enhancing the suitability of LLMs for real-world applications.\n",

This early stage was characterized by foundational work aimed at refining pre-training techniques [3]-[5].The subsequent arrival of ChatGPT [6] marked a pivotal moment, with LLM demonstrating powerful in context learning (ICL) capabilities. RAG research shifted towards providing better information for LLMs to answer more complex and knowledge-intensive tasks during the inference stage, leading to rapid development in RAG studies.

On the other hand, current research tends to focus more on methods, lacking analysis and summarization of how to evaluate RAG. This paper comprehensively reviews the downstream tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methods applicable to RAG. Overall, this paper sets out to meticulously compile and categorize the foundational technical concepts, historical progression, and the spectrum of RAG methodologies and applications that have emerged post-LLMs. It is designed to equip readers and professionals with a detailed and structured understanding of both large models and RAG.

              "\n",
              "Indexing starts with the cleaning and extraction of raw data in diverse formats like PDF, HTML, Word, and Markdown, which is then converted into a uniform plain text format. To accommodate the context limitations of language models, text is segmented into smaller, digestible chunks. Chunks are then encoded into vector representations using an embedding model and stored in vector database. This step is crucial for enabling efficient similarity searches in the subsequent retrieval phase.\n",
              "\n",
              "Retrieval . Upon receipt of a user query, the RAG system employs the same encoding model utilized during the indexing phase to transform the query into a vector representation. It then computes the similarity scores between the query vector and the vector of chunks within the indexed corpus. The system prioritizes and retrieves the top K chunks that demonstrate the greatest similarity to the query. These chunks are subsequently used as the expanded context in prompt.\n",

In cases of ongoing dialogues, any existing conversational history can be integrated into the prompt, enabling the model to engage in multi-turn dialogue interactions effectively.\n",

              "Generation Difficulties . In generating responses, the model may face the issue of hallucination, where it produces content not supported by the retrieved context.

              "\n",
              "Augmentation Hurdles . Integrating retrieved information with the different task can be challenging, sometimes resulting in disjointed or incoherent outputs. The process may also encounter redundancy when similar information is retrieved from multiple sources, leading to repetitive responses. Determining the significance and relevance of various passages and ensuring stylistic and tonal consistency add further complexity. Facing complex issues, a single retrieval based on the original query may not suffice to acquire adequate context information.\n",
              "\n",
              "Moreover, there's a concern that generation models might overly rely on augmented information, leading to outputs that simply echo retrieved content without adding insightful or synthesized information.\n",

To tackle the indexing issues, Advanced RAG refines its indexing techniques through the use of a sliding window approach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of metadata. Additionally, it incorporates several optimization methods to streamline the retrieval process [8].\n",

(Right) Modular RAG inherits and develops from the previous paradigm, showcasing greater flexibility overall. This is evident in the introduction of multiple specific functional modules and the replacement of existing modules. The overall process is not limited to sequential retrieval and generation; it includes methods such as iterative and adaptive retrieval.\n",

              "\n",
              "Pre-retrieval process . In this stage, the primary focus is on optimizing the indexing structure and the original query. The goal of optimizing indexing is to enhance the quality of the content being indexed. This involves strategies: enhancing data granularity, optimizing index structures, adding metadata, alignment optimization, and mixed retrieval. While the goal of query optimization is to make the user's original question clearer and more suitable for the retrieval task. Common methods include query rewriting query transformation, query expansion and other techniques [7], [9]-[11].\n",

The main methods in post-retrieval process include rerank chunks and context compressing. Re-ranking the retrieved information to relocate the most relevant content to the edges of the prompt is a key strategy. This concept has been implemented in frameworks such as LlamaIndex 2 , LangChain 3 , and HayStack [12]. Feeding all relevant documents directly into LLMs can lead to information overload, diluting the focus on key details with irrelevant content.To mitigate this, post-retrieval efforts concentrate on selecting the essential information, emphasizing critical sections, and shortening the context to be processed.\n",

It incorporates diverse strategies for improving its components, such as adding a search module for similarity searches and refining the retriever through fine-tuning. Innovations like restructured RAG modules [13] and rearranged RAG pipelines [14] have been introduced to tackle specific challenges. The shift towards a modular RAG approach is becoming prevalent, supporting both sequential processing and integrated end-to-end training across its components. Despite its distinctiveness, Modular RAG builds upon the foundational principles of Advanced and Naive RAG, illustrating a progression and refinement within the RAG family.\n",

RAGFusion addresses traditional search limitations by employing a multi-query strategy that expands user queries into diverse perspectives, utilizing parallel vector searches and intelligent re-ranking to uncover both explicit and transformative knowledge [16]. The Memory module leverages the LLM's memory to guide retrieval, creating an unbounded memory pool that\n",

Routing in the RAG system navigates through diverse data sources, selecting the optimal pathway for a query, whether it involves summarization, specific database searches, or merging different information streams [19]. The Predict module aims to reduce redundancy and noise by generating context directly through the LLM, ensuring relevance and accuracy [13]. Lastly, the Task Adapter module tailors RAG to various downstream tasks, automating prompt retrieval for zero-shot inputs and creating task-specific retrievers through few-shot query generation [20], [21] .This comprehensive approach not only streamlines the retrieval process but also significantly improves the quality and relevance of the information retrieved, catering to a wide array of tasks and queries with enhanced precision and flexibility.\n",

              "2) New Patterns: Modular RAG offers remarkable adaptability by allowing module substitution or reconfiguration to address specific challenges. This goes beyond the fixed structures of Naive and Advanced RAG, characterized by a simple 'Retrieve' and 'Read' mechanism. Moreover, Modular RAG expands this flexibility by integrating new modules or adjusting interaction flow among existing ones, enhancing its applicability across different tasks.\n",
              "\n",
              "Innovations such as the Rewrite-Retrieve-Read [7]model leverage the LLM's capabilities to refine retrieval queries through a rewriting module and a LM-feedback mechanism to update rewriting model., improving task performance. Similarly, approaches like Generate-Read [13] replace traditional retrieval with LLM-generated content, while ReciteRead [22] emphasizes retrieval from model weights, enhancing the model's ability to handle knowledge-intensive tasks. Hybrid retrieval strategies integrate keyword, semantic, and vector searches to cater to diverse queries. Additionally, employing sub-queries and hypothetical document embeddings (HyDE) [11] seeks to improve retrieval relevance by focusing on embedding similarities between generated answers and real documents.\n",

              "Adjustments in module arrangement and interaction, such as the Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) [23] framework and the iterative Retrieve-Read-Retrieve-Read flow of ITERRETGEN [14], showcase the dynamic use of module outputs to bolster another module's functionality, illustrating a sophisticated understanding of enhancing module synergy. The flexible orchestration of Modular RAG Flow showcases the benefits of adaptive retrieval through techniques such as FLARE [24] and Self-RAG [25]. This approach transcends the fixed RAG retrieval process by evaluating the necessity of retrieval based on different scenarios. Another benefit of a flexible architecture is that the RAG system can more easily integrate with other technologies (such as fine-tuning or reinforcement learning) [26]. For example, this can involve fine-tuning the retriever for better retrieval results, fine-tuning the generator for more personalized outputs, or engaging in collaborative fine-tuning [27].\n",

              "methods for LLMs, RAG is often compared with Fine-tuning (FT) and prompt engineering. Each method has distinct characteristics as illustrated in Figure 4. We used a quadrant chart to illustrate the differences among three methods in two dimensions: external knowledge requirements and model adaption requirements. Prompt engineering leverages a model's inherent capabilities with minimum necessity for external knowledge and model adaption. RAG can be likened to providing a model with a tailored textbook for information retrieval, ideal for precise information retrieval tasks. In contrast, FT is comparable to a student internalizing knowledge over time, suitable for scenarios requiring replication of specific structures, styles, or formats.\n",
              "\n",
              "RAG excels in dynamic environments by offering realtime knowledge updates and effective utilization of external knowledge sources with high interpretability. However, it comes with higher latency and ethical considerations regarding data retrieval. On the other hand, FT is more static, requiring retraining for updates but enabling deep customization of the model's behavior and style. It demands significant computational resources for dataset preparation and training, and while it can reduce hallucinations, it may face challenges with unfamiliar data.\n",

              "In multiple evaluations of their performance on various knowledge-intensive tasks across different topics, [28] revealed that while unsupervised fine-tuning shows some improvement, RAG consistently outperforms it, for both existing knowledge encountered during training and entirely new knowledge. Additionally, it was found that LLMs struggle to learn new factual information through unsupervised finetuning. The choice between RAG and FT depends on the specific needs for data dynamics, customization, and computational capabilities in the application context. RAG and FT are not mutually exclusive and can complement each other, enhancing a model's capabilities at different levels. In some instances, their combined use may lead to optimal performance. The optimization process involving RAG and FT may require multiple iterations to achieve satisfactory results.\n",

When dealing with semi-structured data, one approach involves leveraging the code capabilities of LLMs to execute Text-2-SQL queries on tables within databases, such as TableGPT [85].

Selfmem [17] iteratively creates an unbounded memory pool with a retrieval-enhanced generator, using a memory selector to choose outputs that serve as dual problems to the original question, thus self-enhancing the generative model.

This approach aims to enhance retrieval precision and relevance. On the Knowledge Graph (KG), retrieval granularity includes Entity, Triplet, and sub-Graph. The granularity of retrieval can also be adapted to downstream tasks, such as retrieving Item IDs [40]in recommendation tasks and Sentence pairs [38].

Larger chunks can capture more context, but they also generate more noise, requiring longer processing time and higher costs. While smaller chunks may not fully convey the necessary context, they do have less noise. However, chunks leads to truncation within sentences, prompting the optimization of a recursive splits and sliding window methods, enabling layered retrieval by merging globally related information across multiple retrieval processes [89]. Nevertheless, these approaches still cannot strike a balance between semantic completeness and context length. Therefore, methods like Small2Big have been proposed, where sentences (small) are used as the retrieval unit, and the preceding and following sentences are provided as (big) context to LLMs [90].\n",

To capture the logical relationship between document content and structure, KGP [91] proposed a method of building an index between multiple documents using KG.

Using the Step-back Prompting method [10], the original query is abstracted to generate a high-level concept question (step-back question).

Another approach, LLM-Embedder [97], exploits LLMs to generate reward signals across multiple downstream tasks. The retriever is fine-tuned with two types of supervised signals: hard labels for the dataset and soft rewards from the LLMs. This dual-signal approach fosters a more effective fine-tuning process, tailoring the embedding model to diverse downstream applications.

              "With the deepening of related research, the context of LLMs is continuously expanding [170]-[172]. Presently, LLMs can effortlessly manage contexts exceeding 200,000 tokens 9 . This capability signifies that long-document question answering, previously reliant on RAG, can now incorporate the entire document directly into the prompt. This has also sparked discussions on whether RAG is still necessary when LLMs\n",
              "\n",
              "are not constrained by context. In fact, RAG still plays an irreplaceable role. On one hand, providing LLMs with a large amount of context at once will significantly impact its inference speed, while chunked retrieval and on-demand input can significantly improve operational efficiency. On the other hand, RAG-based generation can quickly locate the original references for LLMs to help users verify the generated answers. The entire retrieval and reasoning process is observable, while generation solely relying on long context remains a black box. Conversely, the expansion of context provides new opportunities for the development of RAG, enabling it to address more complex problems and integrative or summary questions that require reading a large amount of material to answer [49]. Developing new RAG methods in the context of super-long contexts is one of the future research trends.\n",

This situation is figuratively referred to as 'Misinformation can be worse than no information at all'. Improving RAG's resistance to such adversarial or counterfactual inputs is gaining research momentum and has become a key performance metric [48], [50], [82]. Cuconasu et al. [54] analyze which type of documents should be retrieved, evaluate the relevance of the documents to the prompt, their position, and the number included in the context. The research findings reveal that including irrelevant documents can unexpectedly increase accuracy by over 30%, contradicting the initial assumption of reduced quality. These results underscore the importance of developing specialized strategies to integrate retrieval with language generation models, highlighting the need for further research and exploration into the robustness of RAG.\n",

The survey showcases the evolution of RAG technologies and their application on many different tasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms within the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modular RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over its predecessors. RAG's technical integration with other AI methodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, has further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in RAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve its robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts. RAG's application scope is expanding into multimodal domains, adapting its principles to interpret and process diverse data forms like images, videos, and code. This expansion highlights RAG's significant practical implications for AI deployment, attracting interest from academic and industrial sectors.\n",

            "Abstract -Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase impressive capabilities but encounter challenges like hallucination, outdated knowledge, and non-transparent, untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domainspecific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-theart technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evaluation framework and benchmark. At the end, this article delineates the challenges currently faced and points out prospective avenues for research and development 1 .\n",

To overcome challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant document chunks from external knowledge base through semantic similarity calculation. By referencing external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the problem of generating factually incorrect content. Its integration into LLMs has resulted in widespread adoption, establishing RAG as a key technology in advancing chatbots and enhancing the suitability of LLMs for real-world applications.\n",

            "in Figure 1. The development trajectory of RAG in the era of large models exhibits several distinct stage characteristics. Initially, RAG's inception coincided with the rise of the Transformer architecture, focusing on enhancing language models by incorporating additional knowledge through PreTraining Models (PTM). This early stage was characterized by foundational work aimed at refining pre-training techniques [3]-[5].The subsequent arrival of ChatGPT [6] marked a pivotal moment, with LLM demonstrating powerful in context learning (ICL) capabilities. RAG research shifted towards providing better information for LLMs to answer more complex and knowledge-intensive tasks during the inference stage, leading to rapid development in RAG studies. As research progressed, the enhancement of RAG was no longer limited to the inference stage but began to incorporate more with LLM fine-tuning techniques.\n",

            "The burgeoning field of RAG has experienced swift growth, yet it has not been accompanied by a systematic synthesis that could clarify its broader trajectory. This survey endeavors to fill this gap by mapping out the RAG process and charting its evolution and anticipated future paths, with a focus on the integration of RAG within LLMs. This paper considers both technical paradigms and research methods, summarizing three main research paradigms from over 100 RAG studies, and analyzing key technologies in the core stages of 'Retrieval,' 'Generation,' and 'Augmentation.' On the other hand, current research tends to focus more on methods, lacking analysis and summarization of how to evaluate RAG. This paper comprehensively reviews the downstream tasks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation methods applicable to RAG. Overall, this paper sets out to meticulously compile and categorize the foundational technical concepts, historical progression, and the spectrum of RAG methodologies and applications that have emerged post-LLMs. It is designed to equip readers and professionals with a detailed and structured understanding of both large models and RAG. It aims to illuminate the evolution of retrieval augmentation techniques, assess the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches in their respective contexts, and speculate on upcoming trends and innovations.\n",

            "\n",
            "A typical application of RAG is illustrated in Figure 2. Here, a user poses a question to ChatGPT about a recent, widely discussed news. Given ChatGPT's reliance on pretraining data, it initially lacks the capacity to provide updates on recent developments. RAG bridges this information gap by sourcing and incorporating knowledge from external databases. In this case, it gathers relevant news articles related to the user's query. These articles, combined with the original question, form a comprehensive prompt that empowers LLMs to generate a well-informed answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "The RAG research paradigm is continuously evolving, and we categorize it into three stages: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG, as showed in Figure 3. Despite RAG method are cost-effective and surpass the performance of the native LLM, they also exhibit several limitations. The development of Advanced RAG and Modular RAG is a response to these specific shortcomings in Naive RAG.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Fig. 2. A representative instance of the RAG process applied to question answering. It mainly consists of 3 steps. 1) Indexing. Documents are split into chunks, encoded into vectors, and stored in a vector database. 2) Retrieval. Retrieve the Top k chunks most relevant to the question based on semantic similarity. 3) Generation. Input the original question and the retrieved chunks together into LLM to generate the final answer.\n",

            "\n",
            "widespread adoption of ChatGPT. The Naive RAG follows a traditional process that includes indexing, retrieval, and generation, which is also characterized as a 'Retrieve-Read' framework [7].\n",
            "\n",
            "Indexing starts with the cleaning and extraction of raw data in diverse formats like PDF, HTML, Word, and Markdown, which is then converted into a uniform plain text format. To accommodate the context limitations of language models, text is segmented into smaller, digestible chunks. Chunks are then encoded into vector representations using an embedding model and stored in vector database. This step is crucial for enabling efficient similarity searches in the subsequent retrieval phase.\n",
            "\n",
            "Retrieval . Upon receipt of a user query, the RAG system employs the same encoding model utilized during the indexing phase to transform the query into a vector representation. It then computes the similarity scores between the query vector and the vector of chunks within the indexed corpus. The system prioritizes and retrieves the top K chunks that demonstrate the greatest similarity to the query. These chunks are subsequently used as the expanded context in prompt.\n",
            "\n",
            "Generation . The posed query and selected documents are synthesized into a coherent prompt to which a large language model is tasked with formulating a response. The model's approach to answering may vary depending on task-specific criteria, allowing it to either draw upon its inherent parametric knowledge or restrict its responses to the information contained within the provided documents. In cases of ongoing dialogues, any existing conversational history can be integrated into the prompt, enabling the model to engage in multi-turn dialogue interactions effectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, Naive RAG encounters notable drawbacks:\n",
            "\n",
            "Retrieval Challenges . The retrieval phase often struggles with precision and recall, leading to the selection of misaligned or irrelevant chunks, and the missing of crucial information.\n",
            "\n",
            "Generation Difficulties . In generating responses, the model may face the issue of hallucination, where it produces content not supported by the retrieved context. This phase can also suffer from irrelevance, toxicity, or bias in the outputs, detracting from the quality and reliability of the responses.\n",
            "\n",
            "Augmentation Hurdles . Integrating retrieved information with the different task can be challenging, sometimes resulting in disjointed or incoherent outputs. The process may also encounter redundancy when similar information is retrieved from multiple sources, leading to repetitive responses. Determining the significance and relevance of various passages and ensuring stylistic and tonal consistency add further complexity. Facing complex issues, a single retrieval based on the original query may not suffice to acquire adequate context information.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, there's a concern that generation models might overly rely on augmented information, leading to outputs that simply echo retrieved content without adding insightful or synthesized information.\n",
            "\n",
            "## B. Advanced RAG\n",
            "\n",
            "Advanced RAG introduces specific improvements to overcome the limitations of Naive RAG. Focusing on enhancing retrieval quality, it employs pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies. To tackle the indexing issues, Advanced RAG refines its indexing techniques through the use of a sliding window approach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of metadata. Additionally, it incorporates several optimization methods to streamline the retrieval process [8].\n",
            "\n",
            "Fig. 3. Comparison between the three paradigms of RAG. (Left) Naive RAG mainly consists of three parts: indexing, retrieval and generation. (Middle) Advanced RAG proposes multiple optimization strategies around pre-retrieval and post-retrieval, with a process similar to the Naive RAG, still following a chain-like structure. (Right) Modular RAG inherits and develops from the previous paradigm, showcasing greater flexibility overall. This is evident in the introduction of multiple specific functional modules and the replacement of existing modules. The overall process is not limited to sequential retrieval and generation; it includes methods such as iterative and adaptive retrieval.\n",

            "Pre-retrieval process . In this stage, the primary focus is on optimizing the indexing structure and the original query. The goal of optimizing indexing is to enhance the quality of the content being indexed. This involves strategies: enhancing data granularity, optimizing index structures, adding metadata, alignment optimization, and mixed retrieval. While the goal of query optimization is to make the user's original question clearer and more suitable for the retrieval task. Common methods include query rewriting query transformation, query expansion and other techniques [7], [9]-[11].\n",

The main methods in post-retrieval process include rerank chunks and context compressing. Re-ranking the retrieved information to relocate the most relevant content to the edges of the prompt is a key strategy. This concept has been implemented in frameworks such as LlamaIndex 2 , LangChain 3 , and HayStack [12]. Feeding all relevant documents directly into LLMs can lead to information overload, diluting the focus on key details with irrelevant content.To mitigate this, post-retrieval efforts concentrate on selecting the essential information, emphasizing critical sections, and shortening the context to be processed.\n",

            "The modular RAG architecture advances beyond the former two RAG paradigms, offering enhanced adaptability and versatility. It incorporates diverse strategies for improving its components, such as adding a search module for similarity searches and refining the retriever through fine-tuning. Innovations like restructured RAG modules [13] and rearranged RAG pipelines [14] have been introduced to tackle specific challenges. The shift towards a modular RAG approach is becoming prevalent, supporting both sequential processing and integrated end-to-end training across its components. Despite its distinctiveness, Modular RAG builds upon the foundational principles of Advanced and Naive RAG, illustrating a progression and refinement within the RAG family.\n",

            "1) New Modules: The Modular RAG framework introduces additional specialized components to enhance retrieval and processing capabilities. The Search module adapts to specific scenarios, enabling direct searches across various data sources like search engines, databases, and knowledge graphs, using LLM-generated code and query languages [15]. RAGFusion addresses traditional search limitations by employing a multi-query strategy that expands user queries into diverse perspectives, utilizing parallel vector searches and intelligent re-ranking to uncover both explicit and transformative knowledge [16]. The Memory module leverages the LLM's memory to guide retrieval, creating an unbounded memory pool that\n",
            "\n",
            "aligns the text more closely with data distribution through iterative self-enhancement [17], [18]. Routing in the RAG system navigates through diverse data sources, selecting the optimal pathway for a query, whether it involves summarization, specific database searches, or merging different information streams [19]. The Predict module aims to reduce redundancy and noise by generating context directly through the LLM, ensuring relevance and accuracy [13]. Lastly, the Task Adapter module tailors RAG to various downstream tasks, automating prompt retrieval for zero-shot inputs and creating task-specific retrievers through few-shot query generation [20], [21] .This comprehensive approach not only streamlines the retrieval process but also significantly improves the quality and relevance of the information retrieved, catering to a wide array of tasks and queries with enhanced precision and flexibility.\n",
            "\n",
            "2) New Patterns: Modular RAG offers remarkable adaptability by allowing module substitution or reconfiguration to address specific challenges. This goes beyond the fixed structures of Naive and Advanced RAG, characterized by a simple 'Retrieve' and 'Read' mechanism. Moreover, Modular RAG expands this flexibility by integrating new modules or adjusting interaction flow among existing ones, enhancing its applicability across different tasks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Innovations such as the Rewrite-Retrieve-Read [7]model leverage the LLM's capabilities to refine retrieval queries through a rewriting module and a LM-feedback mechanism to update rewriting model., improving task performance. Similarly, approaches like Generate-Read [13] replace traditional retrieval with LLM-generated content, while ReciteRead [22] emphasizes retrieval from model weights, enhancing the model's ability to handle knowledge-intensive tasks. Hybrid retrieval strategies integrate keyword, semantic, and vector searches to cater to diverse queries. Additionally, employing sub-queries and hypothetical document embeddings (HyDE) [11] seeks to improve retrieval relevance by focusing on embedding similarities between generated answers and real documents.\n",

            "Adjustments in module arrangement and interaction, such as the Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) [23] framework and the iterative Retrieve-Read-Retrieve-Read flow of ITERRETGEN [14], showcase the dynamic use of module outputs to bolster another module's functionality, illustrating a sophisticated understanding of enhancing module synergy. The flexible orchestration of Modular RAG Flow showcases the benefits of adaptive retrieval through techniques such as FLARE [24] and Self-RAG [25]. This approach transcends the fixed RAG retrieval process by evaluating the necessity of retrieval based on different scenarios. Another benefit of a flexible architecture is that the RAG system can more easily integrate with other technologies (such as fine-tuning or reinforcement learning) [26]. For example, this can involve fine-tuning the retriever for better retrieval results, fine-tuning the generator for more personalized outputs, or engaging in collaborative fine-tuning [27].\n",

We used a quadrant chart to illustrate the differences among three methods in two dimensions: external knowledge requirements and model adaption requirements. Prompt engineering leverages a model's inherent capabilities with minimum necessity for external knowledge and model adaption. RAG can be likened to providing a model with a tailored textbook for information retrieval, ideal for precise information retrieval tasks. In contrast, FT is comparable to a student internalizing knowledge over time, suitable for scenarios requiring replication of specific structures, styles, or formats.\n",
            "\n",
            "RAG excels in dynamic environments by offering realtime knowledge updates and effective utilization of external knowledge sources with high interpretability. However, it comes with higher latency and ethical considerations regarding data retrieval. On the other hand, FT is more static, requiring retraining for updates but enabling deep customization of the model's behavior and style. It demands significant computational resources for dataset preparation and training, and while it can reduce hallucinations, it may face challenges with unfamiliar data.\n",
            "\n",
            "In multiple evaluations of their performance on various knowledge-intensive tasks across different topics, [28] revealed that while unsupervised fine-tuning shows some improvement, RAG consistently outperforms it, for both existing knowledge encountered during training and entirely new knowledge. Additionally, it was found that LLMs struggle to learn new factual information through unsupervised finetuning. The choice between RAG and FT depends on the specific needs for data dynamics, customization, and computational capabilities in the application context. RAG and FT are not mutually exclusive and can complement each other, enhancing a model's capabilities at different levels. In some instances, their combined use may lead to optimal performance. The optimization process involving RAG and FT may require multiple iterations to achieve satisfactory results.\n",

Handling semi-structured data poses challenges for conventional RAG systems due to two main reasons. Firstly, text splitting processes may inadvertently separate tables, leading to data corruption during retrieval. Secondly, incorporating tables into the data can complicate semantic similarity searches. When dealing with semi-structured data, one approach involves leveraging the code capabilities of LLMs to execute Text-2-SQL queries on tables within databases, such as TableGPT [85]. Alternatively, tables can be transformed into text format for further analysis using text-based methods [75]. However, both of these methods are not optimal solutions, indicating substantial research opportunities in this area.\n",

GenRead [13] replaces the retriever with an LLM generator, finding that LLM-generated contexts often contain more accurate answers due to better alignment with the pre-training objectives of causal language modeling. Selfmem [17] iteratively creates an unbounded memory pool with a retrieval-enhanced generator, using a memory selector to choose outputs that serve as dual problems to the original question, thus self-enhancing the generative model.

This approach aims to enhance retrieval precision and relevance. On the Knowledge Graph (KG), retrieval granularity includes Entity, Triplet, and sub-Graph. The granularity of retrieval can also be adapted to downstream tasks, such as retrieving Item IDs [40]in recommendation tasks and Sentence pairs [38]. Detailed information is illustrated in Table I.\n",

            "In the Indexing phase, documents will be processed, segmented, and transformed into Embeddings to be stored in a vector database. The quality of index construction determines whether the correct context can be obtained in the retrieval phase.\n",
            "\n",
            "1) Chunking Strategy: The most common method is to split the document into chunks on a fixed number of tokens (e.g., 100, 256, 512) [88]. Larger chunks can capture more context, but they also generate more noise, requiring longer processing time and higher costs. While smaller chunks may not fully convey the necessary context, they do have less noise. However, chunks leads to truncation within sentences, prompting the optimization of a recursive splits and sliding window methods, enabling layered retrieval by merging globally related information across multiple retrieval processes [89]. Nevertheless, these approaches still cannot strike a balance between semantic completeness and context length. Therefore, methods like Small2Big have been proposed, where sentences (small) are used as the retrieval unit, and the preceding and following sentences are provided as (big) context to LLMs [90].\n",
            "\n",
            "2) Metadata Attachments: Chunks can be enriched with metadata information such as page number, file name, author,category timestamp. Subsequently, retrieval can be filtered based on this metadata, limiting the scope of the retrieval. Assigning different weights to document timestamps during retrieval can achieve time-aware RAG, ensuring the freshness of knowledge and avoiding outdated information.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to extracting metadata from the original documents, metadata can also be artificially constructed. For example, adding summaries of paragraph, as well as introducing hypothetical questions. This method is also known as Reverse HyDE. Specifically, using LLM to generate questions that can be answered by the document, then calculating the similarity between the original question and the hypothetical question during retrieval to reduce the semantic gap between the question and the answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "- 3) Structural Index: One effective method for enhancing information retrieval is to establish a hierarchical structure for the documents. By constructing In structure, RAG system can expedite the retrieval and processing of pertinent data.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hierarchical index structure . File are arranged in parentchild relationships, with chunks linked to them. Data summaries are stored at each node, aiding in the swift traversal of data and assisting the RAG system in determining which chunks to extract. This approach can also mitigate the illusion caused by block extraction issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "Knowledge Graph index . Utilize KG in constructing the hierarchical structure of documents contributes to maintaining consistency. It delineates the connections between different concepts and entities, markedly reducing the potential for illusions. Another advantage is the transformation of the information retrieval process into instructions that LLM can comprehend, thereby enhancing the accuracy of knowledge retrieval and enabling LLM to generate contextually coherent responses, thus improving the overall efficiency of the RAG system. To capture the logical relationship between document content and structure, KGP [91] proposed a method of building an index between multiple documents using KG. This KG consists of nodes (representing paragraphs or structures in the documents, such as pages and tables) and edges (indicating semantic/lexical similarity between paragraphs or relationships within the document structure), effectively addressing knowledge retrieval and reasoning problems in a multi-document environment.\n",

Formulating a precise and clear question is difficult, and imprudent queries result in subpar retrieval effectiveness. Sometimes, the question itself is complex, and the language is not well-organized. Another difficulty lies in language complexity ambiguity. Language models often struggle when dealing with specialized vocabulary or ambiguous abbreviations with multiple meanings. For instance, they may not discern whether 'LLM' refers to large language model or a Master of Laws in a legal context.\n",

            "Sub-Query . The process of sub-question planning represents the generation of the necessary sub-questions to contextualize and fully answer the original question when combined. This process of adding relevant context is, in principle, similar to query expansion. Specifically, a complex question can be decomposed into a series of simpler sub-questions using the least-to-most prompting method [92].\n",

            "\n",
            "Query Rewrite .The original queries are not always optimal for LLM retrieval, especially in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we can prompt LLM to rewrite the queries. In addition to using LLM for query rewriting, specialized smaller language models, such as RRR (Rewrite-retrieve-read) [7]. The implementation of the query rewrite method in the Taobao, known as BEQUE [9] has notably enhanced recall effectiveness for long-tail queries, resulting in a rise in GMV.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another query transformation method is to use prompt engineering to let LLM generate a query based on the original query for subsequent retrieval. HyDE [11] construct hypothetical documents (assumed answers to the original query). It focuses on embedding similarity from answer to answer rather than seeking embedding similarity for the problem or query. Using the Step-back Prompting method [10], the original query is abstracted to generate a high-level concept question (step-back question). In the RAG system, both the step-back question and the original query are used for retrieval, and both the results are utilized as the basis for language model answer generation.\n",

            "In RAG, retrieval is achieved by calculating the similarity (e.g. cosine similarity) between the embeddings of the question and document chunks, where the semantic representation capability of embedding models plays a key role. This mainly includes a sparse encoder (BM25) and a dense retriever (BERT architecture Pre-training language models). Recent research has introduced prominent embedding models such as AngIE, Voyage, BGE,etc [94]-[96], which are benefit from multi-task instruct tuning. Hugging Face's MTEB leaderboard 7 evaluates embedding models across 8 tasks, covering 58 datasests. Additionally, C-MTEB focuses on Chinese capability, covering 6 tasks and 35 datasets. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to 'which embedding model to use.' However, some specific models are better suited for particular use cases.\n",

Additionally, pre-training language models (PLMs) can be utilized to learn term weights to enhance sparse retrieval. Specifically, it also demonstrates that sparse retrieval models can enhance the zero-shot retrieval capability of dense retrieval models and assist dense retrievers in handling queries containing rare entities, thereby improving robustness.\n",

            "\n",
            "In addition to supplementing domain knowledge, another purpose of fine-tuning is to align the retriever and generator, for example, using the results of LLM as the supervision signal for fine-tuning, known as LSR (LM-supervised Retriever). PROMPTAGATOR [21] utilizes the LLM as a few-shot query generator to create task-specific retrievers, addressing challenges in supervised fine-tuning, particularly in data-scarce domains. Another approach, LLM-Embedder [97], exploits LLMs to generate reward signals across multiple downstream tasks. The retriever is fine-tuned with two types of supervised signals: hard labels for the dataset and soft rewards from the LLMs. This dual-signal approach fosters a more effective fine-tuning process, tailoring the embedding model to diverse downstream applications. REPLUG [72] utilizes a retriever and an LLM to calculate the probability distributions of the retrieved documents and then performs supervised training by computing the KL divergence. This straightforward and effective training method enhances the performance of the retrieval model by using an LM as the supervisory signal, eliminating the need for specific cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, inspired by RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), utilizing LM-based feedback to reinforce the retriever through reinforcement learning.\n",

While PRCA [69] add a pluggable reward-driven contextual adapter to enhance performance on specific tasks. BGM [26] keeps the retriever and LLM fixed,and trains a bridge Seq2Seq model in between.

Reranking can be performed using rule-based methods that depend on predefined metrics like Diversity, Relevance, and MRR, or model-based approaches like Encoder-Decoder models from the BERT series (e.g., SpanBERT), specialized reranking models such as Cohere rerank or bge-raranker-large, and general large language models like GPT [12], [99].\n",

PRCA tackled this issue by training an information extractor [69]. Similarly, RECOMP adopts a comparable approach by training an information condenser using contrastive learning [71]. Each training data point consists of one positive sample and five negative samples, and the encoder undergoes training using contrastive loss throughout this process [102] .\n",

The research shows that instructing LLMs to rearrange challenging samples identified by SLMs leads to significant improvements in various Information Extraction (IE) tasks. Another straightforward and effective approach involves having the LLM evaluate the retrieved content before generating the final answer. This allows the LLM to filter out documents with poor relevance through LLM critique.

In addition to aligning with human preferences, it is also possible to align with the preferences of fine-tuned models and retrievers [79]. When circumstances prevent access to powerful proprietary models or larger parameter open-source models, a simple and effective method is to distill the more powerful models(e.g. GPT-4). Fine-tuning of LLM can also be coordinated with fine-tuning of the retriever to align preferences.

Concurrently, state-of-the-art automated tools like RAGAS [164], ARES [165], and TruLens 8 employ LLMs to adjudicate the quality scores.

This capability signifies that long-document question answering, previously reliant on RAG, can now incorporate the entire document directly into the prompt. This has also sparked discussions on whether RAG is still necessary when LLMs\n",

            "are not constrained by context. In fact, RAG still plays an irreplaceable role. On one hand, providing LLMs with a large amount of context at once will significantly impact its inference speed, while chunked retrieval and on-demand input can significantly improve operational efficiency. On the other hand, RAG-based generation can quickly locate the original references for LLMs to help users verify the generated answers. The entire retrieval and reasoning process is observable, while generation solely relying on long context remains a black box. Conversely, the expansion of context provides new opportunities for the development of RAG, enabling it to address more complex problems and integrative or summary questions that require reading a large amount of material to answer [49]. Developing new RAG methods in the context of super-long contexts is one of the future research trends.\n",

This situation is figuratively referred to as 'Misinformation can be worse than no information at all'. Improving RAG's resistance to such adversarial or counterfactual inputs is gaining research momentum and has become a key performance metric [48], [50], [82]. Cuconasu et al. [54] analyze which type of documents should be retrieved, evaluate the relevance of the documents to the prompt, their position, and the number included in the context. The research findings reveal that including irrelevant documents can unexpectedly increase accuracy by over 30%, contradicting the initial assumption of reduced quality. These results underscore the importance of developing specialized strategies to integrate retrieval with language generation models, highlighting the need for further research and exploration into the robustness of RAG.\n",

The survey showcases the evolution of RAG technologies and their application on many different tasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms within the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modular RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over its predecessors. RAG's technical integration with other AI methodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, has further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in RAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve its robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts. RAG's application scope is expanding into multimodal domains, adapting its principles to interpret and process diverse data forms like images, videos, and code. This expansion highlights RAG's significant practical implications for AI deployment, attracting interest from academic and industrial sectors.\n",

Instead, it includes methods such as iterative and adaptive retrieval. The overall process aims to provide more accurate and relevant information while ensuring stylistic and tonal consistency in the generated responses.\n"

The main goal of Modular Rag is to address some of the limitations of conventional RAG systems.\n",

            "The traditional RAG system relies heavily on unstructured data, primarily sourced from corpora like Wikipedia Dump. However, Modular Rag aims to improve performance by considering other types of data such as semi-structured and structured data. The main challenge with semi-structured data lies in the text splitting process and the incorporation of tables, which can lead to data corruption during retrieval or complicate semantic similarity searches. To tackle this issue, researchers have proposed using Text-2-SQL queries on tables within databases or transforming tables into text format for analysis.\n",

Here, a user poses a question to ChatGPT about a recent, widely discussed news. Given ChatGPT's reliance on pretraining data, it initially lacks the capacity to provide updates on recent developments. RAG bridges this information gap by sourcing and incorporating knowledge from external databases. In this case, it gathers relevant news articles related to the user's query. These articles, combined with the original question, form a comprehensive prompt that empowers LLMs to generate a well-informed answer.\\n\\nThe RAG research paradigm is continuously evolving, and we categorize it into three stages: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG, as showed in Figure 3. Despite RAG method are cost-effective and surpass the performance of the native LLM, they also exhibit several limitations. The development of Advanced RAG and Modular RAG is a response to these specific shortcomings in Naive RAG.\\n\\n## A. Naive RAG\\n\\nThe Naive RAG research paradigm represents the earliest methodology, which gained prominence shortly after the\\n\\nFig. 2. A representative instance of the RAG process applied to question answering. It mainly consists of 3 steps. 1) Indexing. Documents are split into chunks, encoded into vectors, and stored in a vector database. 2) Retrieval. Retrieve the Top k chunks most relevant to the question based on semantic similarity. 3) Generation. Input the original question and the retrieved chunks together into LLM to generate the final answer.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nwidespread adoption of ChatGPT. The Naive RAG follows a traditional process that includes indexing, retrieval, and generation, which is also characterized as a 'Retrieve-Read' framework [7].\\n\\nIndexing starts with the cleaning and extraction of raw data in diverse formats like PDF, HTML, Word, and Markdown, which is then converted into a uniform plain text format. To accommodate the context limitations of language models, text is segmented into smaller, digestible chunks. Chunks are then encoded into vector representations using an embedding model and stored in vector database. This step is crucial for enabling efficient similarity searches in the subsequent retrieval phase.\\n\\nRetrieval . Upon receipt of a user query, the RAG system employs the same encoding model utilized during the indexing phase to transform the query into a vector representation. It then computes the similarity scores between the query vector and the vector of chunks within the indexed corpus. The system prioritizes and retrieves the top K chunks that demonstrate the greatest similarity to the query. These chunks are subsequently used as the expanded context in prompt.\\n\\nGeneration . The posed query and selected documents are synthesized into a coherent prompt to which a large language model is tasked with formulating a response. The model's approach to answering may vary depending on task-specific criteria, allowing it to either draw upon its inherent parametric knowledge or restrict its responses to the information contained within the provided documents. In cases of ongoing dialogues, any existing conversational history can be integrated into the prompt, enabling the model to engage in multi-turn dialogue interactions effectively.\\n\\nHowever, Naive RAG encounters notable drawbacks:\\n\\nRetrieval Challenges . The retrieval phase often struggles with precision and recall, leading to the selection of misaligned or irrelevant chunks, and the missing of crucial information.\\n\\nGeneration Difficulties . In generating responses, the model may face the issue of hallucination, where it produces content not supported by the retrieved context. This phase can also suffer from irrelevance, toxicity, or bias in the outputs, detracting from the quality and reliability of the responses.\""

            "\n",
            "Retrieval sources in the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be categorized into several types, each with unique characteristics and applications. Here's a brief overview of some common retrieval sources:\n",
            "\n",
            "   a) Text Databases: These are static collections of text data stored in databases or files, such as Wikipedia, books, or news articles. They serve as an essential foundation for many RAG systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "   b) Web Search Engines: Online search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo can be leveraged to find relevant information on the web. These sources are dynamic and constantly updated, making them valuable for current events or trending topics.\n",
            "\n",
            "   c) APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): APIs provide programmatic access to specific databases or services, such as public data repositories, social media platforms, or e-commerce sites. They can be useful when targeting a specific domain or type of information.\n",
            "\n",
            "   d) Knowledge Bases: These structured knowledge repositories like DBpedia, Wikidata, and Freebase contain facts, relationships, and concepts between different entities. They can help RAG systems to better understand and reason about the retrieved information.\n",
            "\n",
            "   e) Document Embeddings (Vectors): Pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa can be used to generate dense representations of documents called embeddings. These embeddings enable RAG systems to perform semantic matching between queries and documents more effectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "   f) Question Answering Systems: Platforms like Socratic, Google Assistant, or Alexa can answer questions based on their knowledge bases or by executing web searches. These sources can be integrated into an RAG system for providing answers directly.\n",
            "\n",
            "By combining multiple retrieval sources and applying advanced strategies like pre-retrieval, post-retrieval, fine-tuning, and modular RAG, the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation can be significantly improved, leading to more accurate, informative, and useful responses for users.\n",

This process involves expanding and transforming the original query, ensuring that it provides enough context for the system to generate optimal responses. The methods employed include Query Expansion, Multi-Query, Sub-Query, Chain-of-Verification (CoVe), Query Rewrite, and Query Transformation.\n",

            "\n",
            "   - Multi-Query and Sub-Query techniques use LLMs to plan relevant context for the original query by decomposing it into multiple simpler questions or expanding it into a series of related queries.\n",
            "\n",
            "   - Chain-of-Verification validates expanded queries through the LLM, reducing the risk of hallucinations and increasing reliability.\n",
            "\n",
            "   - Query Transformation retrieves chunks based on a transformed query instead of the original user input. This may include rewriting the original queries using an LLM or employing smaller language models for the task.\n",

It follows a traditional process characterized by three main steps: indexing, retrieval, and generation. In this paradigm, documents are indexed into chunks, relevant chunks are retrieved based on semantic similarity to a user query, and then these chunks are used to generate a response using a large language model (LLM) (Section II.A).\n",

            "2. **Advanced RAG**: This paradigm builds upon Naive RAG by introducing specific improvements aimed at enhancing retrieval quality. It employs pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies to refine indexing techniques and optimize the retrieval process. Advanced RAG focuses on enhancing the quality of indexed content and optimizing user queries to improve retrieval outcomes (Section VII.B).\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **New Modules**: Modular RAG incorporates specialized components such as a Search module for direct searches across diverse data sources, RAGFusion for multi-query strategies, a Memory module for iterative self-enhancement, and a Predict module to reduce redundancy and noise. Additionally, the Task Adapter module customizes RAG for specific downstream tasks, automating prompt retrieval and creating task-specific retrievers [15][20][21].\n",

This approach addresses the limitations of LLMs, particularly their reliance on pretraining data, which may not include the most recent information. RAG operates through a three-step process: indexing, retrieval, and generation.\\n\\n1. **Indexing**: Raw data in various formats (e.g., PDF, HTML) is cleaned, extracted, and converted into a uniform plain text format. The text is then segmented into smaller chunks, encoded into vector representations, and stored in a vector database to facilitate efficient similarity searches during retrieval.\\n\\n2. **Retrieval**: When a user poses a query, the RAG system encodes the query into a vector and computes similarity scores with the indexed chunks. It retrieves the top K chunks that are most relevant to the query, which are then used to provide context for the generation phase.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: The original query and the retrieved chunks are combined into a prompt for the LLM, which generates a response. The model can either draw upon its inherent knowledge or focus solely on the information contained within the retrieved documents.\\n\\nRAG is categorized into three stages: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG, each representing an evolution in the methodology and addressing specific limitations of the previous stages (Section II, Overview of RAG).\\n\\nOverall, RAG serves to improve the quality and relevance of responses generated by LLMs by leveraging external knowledge, making it a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing (NLP) (Section II, Overview of RAG).',\n",

It follows a traditional process characterized by three main steps: indexing, retrieval, and generation. In this paradigm, documents are indexed into chunks, relevant chunks are retrieved based on semantic similarity to a user query, and then these chunks are used to generate a response using a large language model (LLM) (Section II.A).\\n\\n2. **Advanced RAG**: This paradigm builds upon Naive RAG by introducing specific improvements aimed at enhancing retrieval quality. It employs pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies to refine indexing techniques and optimize the retrieval process. Advanced RAG focuses on enhancing the quality of indexed content and optimizing user queries to improve retrieval outcomes (Section VII.B).\\n\\n3. **Modular RAG**: This architecture advances beyond the previous two paradigms by offering enhanced adaptability and versatility. It incorporates diverse strategies for improving its components, such as adding specialized modules for retrieval and processing. Modular RAG allows for the substitution or reconfiguration of modules to address specific challenges, making it more flexible than the fixed structures of Naive and Advanced RAG (Section II.C).\\n\\nThese paradigms illustrate the evolution and refinement of RAG methodologies, each addressing specific limitations and enhancing the overall retrieval and generation process.',\n",

Additionally, the Task Adapter module customizes RAG for specific downstream tasks, automating prompt retrieval and creating task-specific retrievers [15][20][21].\\n\\n2. **New Patterns**: The architecture allows for the substitution or reconfiguration of modules to address specific challenges, moving beyond the fixed structures of Naive and Advanced RAG. Innovations like the Rewrite-Retrieve-Read model and hybrid retrieval strategies enhance the system's flexibility and effectiveness in handling diverse queries [7][13][11].\\n\\n3. **Dynamic Interaction**: Modular RAG supports both sequential processing and integrated end-to-end training across its components, showcasing a sophisticated understanding of module synergy and enhancing the overall retrieval process [14][24][25].\\n\\nOverall, Modular RAG represents a significant progression within the RAG family, building upon foundational principles while offering improved precision and flexibility for a wide array of tasks and queries [13][14].\",\n",

It is a framework that introduces additional specialized components to enhance retrieval and processing capabilities [1]. These components include a Search module for direct searches across various data sources, RAGFusion for expanding user queries into diverse perspectives, a Memory module for guiding retrieval, a Routing module for selecting the optimal pathway for a query, a Predict module for generating context directly through the LLM, and a Task Adapter module for tailoring RAG to various downstream tasks [1]. Modular RAG also allows for module substitution or reconfiguration to address specific challenges, offering remarkable adaptability [2]. It goes beyond the fixed structures of Naive and Advanced RAG, characterized by a simple 'Retrieve' and 'Read' mechanism [II]. The Modular RAG approach is becoming prevalent, supporting both sequential processing and integrated end-to-end training across its components [C].\n",

            "Modular RAG, as mentioned in the context, is an advanced stage in the evolution of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) research paradigm [III]. It is a framework that introduces additional specialized components to enhance retrieval and processing capabilities [1]. These components include a Search module for direct searches across various data sources, RAGFusion for expanding user queries into diverse perspectives, a Memory module for guiding retrieval, a Routing module for selecting the optimal pathway for a query, a Predict module for generating context directly through the LLM, and a Task Adapter module for tailoring RAG to various downstream tasks [1]. Modular RAG also allows for module substitution or reconfiguration to address specific challenges, offering remarkable adaptability [2]. It goes beyond the fixed structures of Naive and Advanced RAG, characterized by a simple 'Retrieve' and 'Read' mechanism [II]. The Modular RAG approach is becoming prevalent, supporting both sequential processing and integrated end-to-end training across its components [C].\n",
