Reducing Last-Mile Delivery Costs**\n\n- **Solution Proposals:**\n  - Implement alternative delivery methods such as drone delivery, which can reduce transportation costs in urban areas by bypassing traffic. \n  - Establish local depots or fulfillment centers in high-density areas to minimize delivery routes, using advanced route optimization algorithms to plan efficient delivery paths. \n  - Explore partnerships with local courier services for same-day delivery options, leveraging their knowledge of the area and reducing costs associated with larger delivery services.\n\n**2. Improving Warehouse Picking Efficiency**\n\n- **Solution Proposals:**\n  - Redesign the warehouse layout using a U-shaped or wave picking strategy for optimized flow.\n  - Introduce automated picking systems such as robots and mobile picking carts that will significantly cut down on the average picking time of 30-60 minutes per order to potentially under 15 minutes.\n  - Employ a clustering technique in order picking where similar items are grouped together to streamline the process further.\n\n**3. Optimizing Return Processing**\n\n- **Solution Proposals:**\n  - Implement a return management system (RMS) that automates the steps in the return process, from initiation to inventory restocking. This technology can reduce processing times to under 24 hours.\n  - Establish clear baselines for returns, such as offering free returns within a specified period, to enhance customer experience and satisfaction.\n  - Create a dedicated return processing area in warehouses for efficient handling of incoming returns.\n\n**4.
