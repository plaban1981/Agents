            "\n",
            "William Shakespeare (1564-1616) is widely regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. His contributions to English literature are immense and far-reaching. Here are some of the most significant:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Invention of New Words and Phrases**: Shakespeare introduced many words and phrases that are still in use today. It's estimated that he contributed over 1700 words to the English language, including \"assassination,\" \"bedazzled,\" \"fashionable,\" and \"lonely.\"\n",
            "2. **Development of the English Sonnet**: Shakespeare popularized the sonnet, a 14-line poem with a specific rhyme scheme. His sonnets are still studied and admired for their beauty, complexity, and emotional depth.\n",
            "3. **Shaping the English Language**: Shakespeare's writing helped to standardize English spelling and grammar. His plays and poems also influenced the development of English vocabulary, idioms, and expressions.\n",
            "4. **Establishing the English Theatre**: Shakespeare's plays helped to establish the English theatre as a major cultural institution. His company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men (later known as the King's Men), was one of the first professional theatre companies in England.\n",
            "5. **Creating Iconic Characters**: Shakespeare's characters, such as Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, Romeo, and Juliet, are iconic figures in world literature. They have become part of the cultural consciousness and continue to inspire new adaptations and interpretations.\n",
            "6. **Exploring the Human Condition**: Shakespeare's plays and poems explore universal themes and emotions, including love, power, ambition, mortality, and the human condition. His works continue to resonate with audiences today.\n",
            "7. **Influence on Literature and the Arts**: Shakespeare's influence can be seen in literature, music, art, film, and other creative fields. Many authors, including Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and the Romantic poets, were influenced by his works.\n",
            "8. **Preserving History and Culture**: Shakespeare's plays often drew on historical events and figures, preserving them for future generations. His works also provide insights into the culture and society of Elizabethan England.\n",
            "9. **Creating a New Form of Drama**: Shakespeare's plays helped to develop a new form of drama, combining elements of Greek tragedy, Roman comedy, and English folk traditions. His plays are known for their complex characters, nuanced language, and exploration of themes.\n",
            "10. **Enduring Legacy**: Shakespeare's works continue to be performed, studied, and admired around the world. His legacy extends beyond literature to inspire new artistic creations, adaptations, and interpretations.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, Shakespeare's contributions to English literature are immeasurable. He enriched the language, expanded the possibilities of drama and poetry, and created works that continue to inspire and captivate audiences to this day.\n",

            "In OOP, a program is composed of objects that interact with each other. Each object represents a real-world entity or concept, such as a car, a bank account, or a user.

            "* **Objects**: Instances of classes, which have their own set of attributes (data) and methods (behavior).\n",
            "* **Inheritance**: Creating a new class that inherits the properties and methods of an existing class.\n",
            "* **Composition**: Creating a new object from one or more existing objects.\n",

            "* **Easier maintenance**: OOP encourages a more organized and structured approach to coding, making it easier to identify and fix issues.\n",

Here's a step-by-step procedure to make a delicious and authentic Avial:\n",

            "Avial is a traditional Kerala dish made with a variety of vegetables, coconut, and spices. It's a popular side dish served with rice, and its unique flavor profile is a result of the careful blending of ingredients.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Ingredients:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* 1 cup mixed vegetables (choose 5-6 from the following: yardlong beans, carrots, plantain, drumsticks, potatoes, cucumber, beans, and snake gourd)\n",
            "* 1 cup grated coconut\n",
            "* 1/2 cup curd (yogurt)\n",
            "* 1/4 cup tamarind paste\n",
            "* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder\n",
            "* 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds\n",
            "* Salt, to taste\n",
            "* 2 tablespoons coconut oil\n",
            "* 2-3 green chilies, chopped (optional)\n",
            "* Fresh curry leaves, for garnish\n",
            "\n",
            "**Step-by-Step Procedure:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Prepare the vegetables:** Cut the mixed vegetables into small pieces and set them aside.\n",
            "2. **Grind the coconut:** Grind 1 cup of grated coconut into a smooth paste using a blender or grinder. You can add a little water to facilitate grinding, but be cautious not to add too much.\n",
            "3. **Make the tamarind paste:** Soak a small ball of tamarind in 1/4 cup of warm water. Let it soak for about 10-15 minutes. Then, mash the tamarind and extract the paste. Discard the pulp and seeds.\n",
            "4. **Heat oil and sauté cumin seeds:** In a large pan, heat 1 tablespoon of coconut oil over medium heat. Add 1/4 teaspoon of cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.\n",
            "5. **Add mixed vegetables:** Add the cut mixed vegetables to the pan and sauté until they're partially cooked (about 5-7 minutes).\n",
            "6. **Add ground coconut, tamarind paste, turmeric powder, and salt:** Add the ground coconut paste, tamarind paste, turmeric powder, and salt to the pan. Mix well to combine.\n",
            "7. **Add curd and mix:** Add 1/2 cup of curd to the pan and mix well. This will help to balance the flavors and create a creamy texture.\n",
            "8. **Add more oil and simmer:** Add another tablespoon of coconut oil to the pan and simmer the mixture for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are fully cooked and the Avial has thickened slightly.\n",
            "9. **Add green chilies (optional):** If you like a bit of heat in your Avial, add 2-3 chopped green chilies to the pan and simmer for another minute.\n",
            "10. **Garnish and serve:** Garnish the Avial with fresh curry leaves and serve with steaming hot rice.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Tips and Variations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* Use a variety of vegetables to create a colorful and flavorful Avial.\n",
            "* Adjust the amount of tamarind paste and curd according to your taste preferences.\n",
            "* You can add a dash of mustard seeds or fenugreek seeds while sautéing the cumin seeds for extra flavor.\n",
            "* Avial can be made with a single type of vegetable, like plantain or drumsticks, for a different twist.\n",
            "* Experiment with different spice levels by adding more or less green chilies.\n",
            "\n",
