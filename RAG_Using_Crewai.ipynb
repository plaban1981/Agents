Exercise period: It means the time period which starts after the completion of vesting period within which an employee can exercise his/her right to apply for shares against the vested options in pursuance of the scheme of ESOP approved by the shareholders in general meeting by way of Special Resolution. Exercise price: Means the price payable by an employee for exercising the options granted in pursuance of the scheme of ESOP. ARTICLE JANUARY 2024 | 107 CHARTERED SECRETARY\\n\\nESOP? A. Companies are free to decide the exercise price, which may be issued at a discount or premium but the exercise price determined by the Company shall not be less than the par value of the shares. Q. Does it mandatory for the Company to issue and allot only fresh shares under ESOP scheme? A. No, it is not mandatory for the company to issue and allot only fresh shares under ESOP scheme, but it may choose either option: 1. If Company is willing to issue fresh shares, it should adopt direct route to issue and allot shares under the scheme of ESOP. 2. If the Company is willing to channelize its existing share only, in such case Company should adopt Trust route to issue and allot shares under the scheme of ESOP. Q. How are ESOP taxed in India? A. ESOPs have dual tax effects: 1. When an employee exercises their rights and purchases company’s stock. 2. When the employee sells the stock after exercising the option. TAX TREATMENT AT THE TIME OF BUYING THE SHARES Employees can exercise\\n\\nFAQs Q. What is an ESOP? A. Thus, we can say that ‘ESOP’ stands for ‘Employee Stock Option Plan’ which is a kind of employee benefit plan that gives employees the right to purchase shares of their employer company at a pre-determined price after a certain time period. Q. Does the ESOP supplement the salary of an employee? A. From the point view of monetary benefits, we can say that ESOPs are often used to supplement the salaries of employees. Instead of paying high salary, employees may be offered ESOPs, which may generate more wealth for employees if the Company is growing and generating good amount of earnings which is over and above break-even point. Q. Is ESOP risky and having any possibility of monetary loss? A. It may be risky, if an employee accepts ESOPs instead of a higher salary, and the organization where they are employed is not growing as per the market standards or in comparison to its competitors, ESOP may result in monetary loss.
